# Raw Data
This holds compressed data collected from experiments. This will allow to reproduce plots for analysis.

## Experiement: Checking linearity
[This data](check_linearity/) was collected from the experiment where we adjusted the CPU resources to the AI workload to check allocating more resource increases the performance.

## Experiement: PD controller
[This data](pd_controller/) was collected from the experiement where we implemented a PD controller. The framerate at the data generator is fixed to 1000.
